  <h2>About the site</h2>

<p>We are trying to address the power of technology and the impacts it can have on peopleâ€™s thinking and beliefs. Technology is a powerful tool that can be used to communicate with people from all over the country, and all over the world. This comes with heavy responsibility, technology can be used to promote positivity and empowerment, while at the same time spreading hate and negativity. Technology has been used in vital ways to address political issues, events, education, public opinion, discrimination, etc. Our goal is to spread awareness about the role technology can have and to further the understanding of its effects.</p>
